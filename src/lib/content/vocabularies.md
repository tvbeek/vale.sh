Vocabularies allow you to maintain custom lists of terminology independent of
your styles.

```properties
StylesPath = "..."

# Here's were we define the exceptions to use in *all*
# `BasedOnStyles`.
Vocab = Some-Name

[*]
# 'Vale' and 'MyStyle' automatically respect all
# custom exceptions.
#
# The built-in 'Vale' style is required for using
# `Vale.Terms`, `Vale.Avoid`, or `Vale.Spelling`.
BasedOnStyles = Vale, MyStyle
```

Each `Vocab` is a single folder
(stored at `<StylesPath>/config/vocabularies/<name>/`) consisting of two
plain-text files&mdash;`accept.txt` and `reject.txt`&mdash;that contain one
regular expression per line.

The effects of using a custom `Vocab` are as follows:

- Entries in `accept.txt` are added to every exception list in all styles
  listed in `BasedOnStyles`&mdash;meaning that you now only need to update your
  project's _vocabulary_ to customize third-party styles.

- Entries in `accept.txt` are automatically added to a substitution rule
  (`Vale.Terms`), ensuring that any occurrences of these words or phrases
  exactly match their corresponding entry in `accept.txt`.

- Entries in `reject.txt` are automatically added to an existence rule
  (`Vale.Avoid`) that will flag all occurrences as errors.

- Entries in `accept.txt` and `reject.txt` should need little overlap, if any.
  For example, if you add `JavaScript` to `accept.txt`, then you do not need
  to add an overlapping regular expression entry of `[Jj]avascript` in
  `reject.txt`. Vale will enforce correct casing by virtue of the entry's
  presence in `accept.txt`. See the section "Case sensitivity" for details.

This means that your exceptions can be developed independent of a style,
allowing you to use the same exceptions with multiple styles or switch styles
without having to re-implement them.

## Folder structure

<Alert>
In versions of Vale prior to 3.0, vocabularies were stored in
<code>$StylesPath/Vocab</code>. When upgrading from an older version of Vale,
you'll need  to move your vocabularies to the new
<code>$StylesPath>/config/vocabularies</code> location.
</Alert>

Vocabulary entries are stored in `<StylesPath>/config/vocabularies/<name>/` and
are then referenced by `<name>` in `.vale.ini`. For example, consider the
following folder structure:

```plaintext
$ tree styles
├───MyStyle
├───config
│   └───vocabularies
│       ├───Blog
│       │   ├───accept.txt
│       │   └───reject.txt
│       └───Marketing
│           ├───accept.txt
│           └───reject.txt
└───MyOtherStyle
```

Here, our `StylesPath` (`/styles`) contains two styles (`MyStyle` and
`MyOtherStyle`) and two vocabularies (`Blog` and `Marketing`). You can then
reference these entries by their folder name:

```properties
StylesPath = styles

Vocab = Blog

[*]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, MyStyle
```

## File format

Both `accept.txt` and `reject.txt` are plain-text files that take one
entry per line:

```plaintext
first
[pP]y.*\b
third
```

The entries are evaulated as case-sensitive (except for rules
extending `spelling`, as mentioned above) regular expressions.

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and are ignored.

## Case sensitivity

An important factor in successfully implementing a custom vocabulary is
understanding how Vale handles case sensitivity.

While most spell-checking tools ignore case altogether, Vale's vocabulary files
are case-aware by default. This means that, for example, a vocabulary
consisting of

```plaintext
MongoDB
```

will enforce the _exact_ use of "MongoDB": "mongoDB," "MongoDb," etc., will all
result in errors. There are two ways around this.

First, you can indicate that a given entry should be case-insensitive by
providing an appropriate regular expression:

```plaintext
(?i)MongoDB
[Oo]bservability
```

The first entry, `(?i)MongoDB`, marks the entire pattern as case-insensitive while
the second, `[Oo]bservability`, provides two acceptable options.

You can also disable `Vale.Terms` and just use `Vale.Spelling`:

```properties
[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = Vale

Vale.Terms = NO
```

This will provide a more traditional spell-checking experience.

## Relation to ignore files

The functionality of vocabularies is similar to the existing concept of
[_ignore_ files](/docs/).

The major differences are that vocabularies apply to multiple extension points
(rather than just `spelling`), support regular expressions, and have built-in
rules associated with them (`Vale.Terms` and `Vale.Avoid`).

In general, this means that ignore files are for style _creators_ while
vocabularies are for style _users_:

- If you're developing or maintaining a style, you may still want to include a
  custom `spelling` rule&mdash;`MyStyle.Spelling`&mdash;that packages its own
  ignore files.

- As a user of styles, vocabularies should be able to replace the use of ignore
  files completely.

## Rules targeting vocabulary entries

In cases where you want to write a rule that needs to match against an
otherwise ignored token, you can add `vocab: false` to the rule definition.
For example,

```yaml
extends: existence
message: Did you mean '%s'?
vocab: false
tokens:
  # "MonoDB" can be in a vocab
  - MongoDB
```
